# Chicago DevSecOps Meetup 2019-03-06

It's time to launch your new product, but are you confident it's not going to crash and burn once you go-live?

This month, Yello Cloud Infrastructure Engineer, Jason Hernandez, will show you how to use JMeter -- the industry standard load and performance measuring tool. Jason will walk us through some of the JMeter features and plugins he used to simulate web traffic with the goal of understanding performance capabilities of Yello's new Interview Scheduling product.

During our lightning round, Jason Allen, will talk about FedRAMP. If you want to provide products to US government departments with high security requirements, then understanding FedRAMP is a must.
